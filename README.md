Please, make your code fit in an 80x24 character screen, I beg you

If you use any C version above 11, you're a maniac

The idea for `foo8664` as my username came when:
* I discovered that `foo`, `bar`, and names like these are called [metasyntatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable), isn't that a cool name?
* I started learning x86-64, intel's ISA (actually AMD's, Itanium failed, AMD64 didn't)
But the more I learn about RISC-V and the reasoning behind it's design choices,
the more I want to replace this for something like `foo-V`, the fact that I don't
even remember some of the x86 specifics anymore also speaks a lot

I'm exploring kernel development right now, studying up on xv6, both the book
and the [6.1810](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2024) class at MIT, I'll probably read _Modern Operating Systems_ later too
